SplitShot :
A simple bullet hell, implemented as part of learning Godot engine.


Game Rules:

- Shoot enemies to score.
- Enemies have a chance to spawn an additional enemy when shot.
- If enemies hit you, you lose health. Game over if health drops to 0.
- Missed shots hit the walls and award a small negative score.
- Dont get hit for some duration to get passive health regen.
- Health Regen and Positive Scores are only awarded if you are relatively near center, and not if you wander too far into diagonal corners.
- After taking damage, you are immune for a short time, but will still get knocked back and will also be counted towards delay before health regen kicks in.
